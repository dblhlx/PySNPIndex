# PySNPIndex
BSA-Seq data analysis - Python implementation of the SNP index method

This is the Python implementation of [the SNP index method](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tpj.12105) for BSA-Seq data analysis. You can issue the command `python PyBSASeq_DSI.py` in a terminal to test the script. It is required to uncompress the [snp_final.tsv.bz2 file]() to the working directory before testing.
