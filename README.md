# PySNPIndex
BSA-Seq data analysis - Python implementation of the SNP index method

This is the Python implementation of [the SNP index method](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tpj.12105) for BSA-Seq data analysis. You can issue the command `python PySNPIndex.py` in a terminal to test the script. It is required to uncompress the [snp_final.tsv.bz2 file](https://github.com/dblhlx/PyBSASeq/blob/master/snp_final.tsv.bz2) to the working directory before testing. Options as in [PyBSASeq](https://github.com/dblhlx/PyBSASeq) are needed to use the script for your own SNP datasets.
