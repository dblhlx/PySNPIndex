# The allele frequency method
BSA-Seq data analysis - Python implementation of the allele frequency method

This is the Python implementation of [the allele frequency method](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tpj.12105) for BSA-Seq data analysis. The script can be tested by issuing the command `python PySNPIndex.py` in a terminal. The file [snp_final.tsv.bz2](https://github.com/dblhlx/PyBSASeq/blob/master/snp_final.tsv.bz2) needs to be uncompressed to the working directory before testing. Options as in [PyBSASeq](https://github.com/dblhlx/PyBSASeq) are needed to use the script for your own SNP datasets.
